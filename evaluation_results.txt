Prompt:  Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles .

Prompt:  The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways . These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of Fremont had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ 532 vehicles daily . The traffic nadir was 4 @,@ 018 vehicles east of Newaygo . In addition , MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . 

Fine-Tuned Response:  The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ), as a part of its maintenance responsibilities, tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways. These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ), which represents the average number of average annual daily vehicles ( AADV ) passing a point on a highway segment per day. In 2010, MDOT determined that I @-@ 69 had an AADT of 2 @.@ 
Baseline Response:  The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ), as a part of its maintenance responsibilities, tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways. These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ), which is the number of vehicles that pass a point in a given time period. The AADT is a measure of the traffic volume on a road, calculated as the total number of vehicles that pass a point in a given time period divided by the length

Prompt:  The first usage of M @-@ 82 was in the Upper Peninsula by July 1 , 1919 . The trunkline started at M @-@ 25 and ran north of Newberry to the vicinity of Eight Mile Corner . It was later replaced by M @-@ 48 in 1926 . 

Fine-Tuned Response:  The first usage of M @-@ 82 was in the Upper Peninsula by July 1, 1919. The trunkline started at M @-@ 25 and ran north of Newberry to the vicinity of Eight Mile Corner. From there, the line ran east to west through the heart of the Copper Country, passing through the small communities of Copper City, Houghton, and Grand Marais. The line ended at a junction with the Great Northern Railway just south of H
Baseline Response:  The first usage of M @-@ 82 was in the Upper Peninsula by July 1, 1919. The trunkline started at M @-@ 25 and ran north of Newberry to the vicinity of Eight Mile Corner. The line was extended north from there to M @-@ 82, and then east to M @-@ 82, where it ended. This was the first section of road in the Upper Peninsula to be paved with asphalt. The road was

Prompt:  The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 . It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City . The highway was routed through Ferry , Hesperia and Fremont , replacing M @-@ 41 . In late 1936 , M @-@ 46 was extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 routing . This concurrent section became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , shortening M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in Newaygo . The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 . Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby . 

Fine-Tuned Response:  The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926. It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City. The highway was routed through Ferry, where it joined US 31, before heading south on US 31 along with Ferry Road. The route ended at the current southern terminus of M @-@ 82, where it met US 281. In 1932, the M
Baseline Response:  The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926. It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City. The highway was routed through Ferry, with US 31 running from Ferry to the junction with US 131. The highway was rerouted to run from Ferry to the junction with US 131 in 1930, and from US 131 to the northern junction with US 31 in

Prompt:  Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again . This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era , bypassing Ferry . A larger change around 1969 reconfigured the highway designations in Oceana County . M @-@ 20 replaced M @-@ 82 west of Hesperia , to end at New Era instead of Muskegon . The new M @-@ 120 designation replaced M @-@ 20 south of Hesperia . M @-@ 82 now ran from Hesperia to Newaygo only . The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City . M @-@ 46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs , and replaced M @-@ 57 between Cedar Springs and Casnovia . This freed up the Newaygo to Howard City highway for a return to the M @-@ 82 designation . The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M @-@ 120 was eliminated in favor of M @-@ 120 . The M @-@ 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of Fremont , resulting in the current highway routing . 

Fine-Tuned Response:  Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again. This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era, bypassing Ferry. A larger change around 1969 moved the western terminus of SR 99 to the new Ferry Road – California State Route 138 freeway, about 3 miles ( 5 km ) to the west. The old route was retired and became part of SR 138. The state
Baseline Response:  Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again. This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era, bypassing Ferry.
